# StyleGAN and Advancements

## (Optional) StyleGAN Walkthrough and Beyond

Want another explanation of StyleGAN? This article provides a great walkthrough of StyleGAN and even discusses StyleGAN's successor: StyleGAN2!

## (Optional Notebook) Finetuning Notebook: FreezeD

+ [Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/https-deeplearning-ai/GANs-Public/blob/master/C2W3_FreezeD_(Optional).ipynb)

In this notebook, you'll learn about and implement the fine-tuning approach proposed in [Freeze the Discriminator: a Simple Baseline for Fine-Tuning GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10964) (Mo et al. 2020), which introduces the concept of freezing the upper layers of the discriminator in fine-tuning. Specifically, you'll fine-tune a pretrained StyleGAN to generate anime faces from human faces.
