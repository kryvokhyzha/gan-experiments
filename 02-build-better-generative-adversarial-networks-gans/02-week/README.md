This is a hitchhiker's guide to score-based generative models, a family of approaches based on [estimating gradients of the data distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05600). They have obtained high-quality samples comparable to GANs (like below, figure from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09011)) without requiring adversarial training, and are considered by some to be the [new contender to GAN](https://ajolicoeur.wordpress.com/the-new-contender-to-gans-score-matching-with-langevin-sampling/)s.
